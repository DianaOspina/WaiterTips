# WaiterTips
Waiter Tips is an analysis of a tips dataset in which a male waiter recorded information about each tip received over a few months working at a restaurant. For this analysis, Python was the analytical tool used along with Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy libraries. The project involved data preparation and exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset, which led to the research question: "Is there a difference in tipping behavior by sex?” Calculations of summary statistics were performed including measures of central tendency, variability, and distribution. It was observed that on average, tip percentage was higher for females than for males. The variable ‘tip percentage” was then tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Since the data did not meet the assumptions of normality a nonparametric test, Wilcoxon rank sum was conducted to determine if the observed difference in tipping behavior by sex was statistically significant. The results indicated no statistically significant difference in tipping behavior by sex. This conclusion suggests that the observed difference between males and females may have arisen by chance.
